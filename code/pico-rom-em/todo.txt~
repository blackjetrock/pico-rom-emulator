Possible Future Additions
=========================

1. Write to paknnnn.opk and a lastpak.opk, maybe put that at start of list
   so quick to load.

2. Maybe have an autoload.pak so that when switche don the same datapak is
   present automatically, giving a sort of non volatile RAM buffer.

3. Sort out pak size problems. At present only emulates a 32K RAMPAK. Other
   sizes would be nice.
   
4. Check read-only functionality works.
